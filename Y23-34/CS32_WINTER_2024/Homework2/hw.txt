Differences - The stack goes out in line directly east before going other directions - in other words it is a depth first search. The queue goes out radially as in each node that it visits it visits all surrounding nodes until it goes any further. If both search algorithms were viewewed side by side the queue would look like a a circle growing bigger while the  stack would look like a series of lines stretching in single directions.
