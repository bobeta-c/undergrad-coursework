A. Yes - conversion to float will yield the same conversion issues.
only the least significant values will be truncated for both.
B. no overflow in the left but on the right side, for example Tmin - 1 would return 0 and that would be casted to double
as opposed to Tmin-1 stored as a double
C. Yes because there is no overflow, and everything will only round to infinity as well
as the fact that these doubles will be strictly lower than the  max int
D. Yes because there is no overflow behavior with floats
E. no because one may be zero and result in NaN calcuation
