%% Implementaion of the velocity field of ODE

function f = velocity_field(t, y)

%$ Inputs
% - t : time (scalar)
% - y : "location" (4-by-1 vector)
%% Outputs
% - f : "velocity" (4-by-1 vector)

%% Parameters

mu = 0.012277471 ;
mu0 = 1 - mu ;

%% Define "velocity"

% Initialize f by a zero 4-by-1 vector
f = zeros(4,1) ;
